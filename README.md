# Demo Box Injector Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension injects a warning box into every post on X.com (formerly Twitter) that includes a heading, subtext, and a blur effect. The extension also includes a "View Post" button that allows users to remove the blur for 17 seconds. Afterward, a cooldown timer of 17 minutes is applied before the button can be clicked again.

## Features
- A warning box with customizable text that overlays every post.
- Gaussian blur effect over posts, hiding their content.
- A "View Post" button to temporarily remove the blur for 17 seconds.
- 17-minute cooldown after each click, during which the button is disabled.
